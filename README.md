# weather-app
This is my weather application following [Andrew Mead](http://www.mead.io/)'s Complete Node.js Developer Course on Udemy. This repo is used purely for learning exercises and the course content should not be interpreted as something I've created on my own.

The weather application uses the Google Maps and Dark Sky APIs to display current weather based on an address given in the command line.
